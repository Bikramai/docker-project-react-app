Docker is a platform that enables consistent application development, deployment, and shipping by packaging applications with their dependencies into isolated environments called containers. Containers, unlike virtual machines, share the host operating systemâ€™s kernel, making them more lightweight and resource-efficient. Docker utilizes a client-server architecture, with the server component, or Docker engine, managing container creation and execution.
